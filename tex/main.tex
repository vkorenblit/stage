\section{Introduction}
Embedded systems are present in many kinds of devices, ranging from aircraft
systems to consumer electronics. Thanks to the technological advances, some
recent embedded sytems outperform desktop PCs of several years ago, allowing
them to run a Linux system. However, while regular Linux distributions are
generic and well suited for desktop systems, embedded systems present different
kinds of hardware/software constraints that need to be satisfied, which normaly
involves applying modifications to the operating system. Because of this, there
exist build sytems like Buildroot that can generate a fully customized embedded
Linux system optimized for a particular target hardware.\\\\
Two aspects that can be customized using Buildroot are the packages that will be
installed on the target system and the cross-compilation toolchain that is used
to build them. LLVM as a compiler infrastructure can play both roles in Buildroot:
one one hand, it can be seen as a target package which provides functionalitites
such as code optimization and Just In Time compilation to other packages, whereas
on the other hand it opens the possibility of creating a cross-compilation
toolchain that could be an alternative to Buildroot's default one, which is
based on GNU tools.\\\\
This project is mainly focused on LLVM as a target package. Nevertheless, it also
discusses some relevant aspects which need to be considered when building an
LLVM/Clang-based cross-compilation toolchain.

\subsection{Organization}
This document is organized in a way that the technologies involved in the
project are first introduced in order to provide the reader with the necessary
information to understand the main objectives of it and interpret how software
components interact with each other.\\\\
Section \ref{Buildroot} discusses the most
important aspects of Buildroot in order to provide some background information.
Section \ref{LLVM} introduces the LLVM project from the user's point of view and
then digs into its internal aspects to show how its unique design presents
several advantages over GCC. As the first goal of this project is providing
LLVM support for OpenGL, Section \ref{Linux graphics stack} discusses the
Linux Graphics Stack to see which is the role of LLVM in this complex system.
Section \ref{LLVM/Clang integration to Buildroot} contains the development of
all the project itself, doing emphasis in all the problems encountered along
the way. As this work was done in several iterations, this section shows the
state of progress at different dates, which gives a clear view of how the
project evolved and which functionalities were added on each iteration. Finally,
Section \ref{Conclusions and future work} discusses possible future work and
concludes the document.

\section{Smile}
Smile is a French company specialized in the integration of open source
solutions. Created in 1991, it has 15 agencies in 7 countries: France,
Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Morocco and Ukraine. It offers
consulting services in design, development and integration of open source
solutions but also provides training sessions, technical support and hosting
services. The main offers are grouped into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Digital
  \item Business Apps
  \item Embedded \& IoT
  \item Outsourcing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Organizational structure}
Smile is organized into autonomous entities called Business Units (BU), some
offering products and services which target a specific market segment and
some others that work internally for the company. Some examples of BUs are:
Embedded and Connected Systems (ECS), Digital, Sales Outsourcing, Hosting,
E-commerce and Recruiting, among others.

\subsection{Open Source School}
In February 2016, Smile launched the Open Source School (OSS) in partnership
with EPSI, an engineering school. This is the first higher education school
dedicated to open source technologies which offers a 3-year program (BAC+5)
to train professionals to design, build and manage large open source
projects.

\newpage
\section{Buildroot} \label{Buildroot}

Buildroot is an open source build system that allows to build from source some
or all of the following components of an Embedded Linux System:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cross-compilation toolchain
  \item Root filesystem
  \item Bootloader
  \item Kernel image
\end{itemize}
It is based on GNU Make and Kconfig, aiming to provide the user with a tool that
generates a fully customizable Linux system, easily and in a few minutes. Currently,
Buildroot supports many architectures, such as x86, ARM, AArch64, MIPS, PowerPC
and Microblaze among others. There are more than 2200 packages available and the
documentation explains in detail the process to add new ones.\\\\
Fig.\ref{fig:menuconfig} shows the how the system can be configured by using
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont make menuconfig}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/menuconfig.png}
  \caption{Buildroot}
  \label{fig:menuconfig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cross-compilation toolchain}

A toolchain is the set of tools that allows to compile source code into executables
that can run on a target platform. A standard GNU toolchain consists of four
main components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Binutils: set of binary utilities such as ld, as, objdump, readelf, etc.
  \item GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
  \item C library: an API that allows user-space applications to
  interact with the Linux kernel
  \item Linux kernel headers: they contain definitions and constants needed to
  access the kernel directly
\end{itemize}
Buildroot uses cross-compilation, which means that the build environment is
separated from the target environment. This approach has many benefits considering
that the embedded target is generally slower than the host and sometimes it cannot
even run a compiler. The main advantages are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increasing productivity (host is faster than target)
  \item Build an application or a complete system for many platforms on the same
  machine
  \item Bootstraping a compiler on a new architecture
\end{itemize}
Buildroot offers the possibility of building an entire cross-toolchain from
source or using a pre-compiled one. When choosing the first option, it is possible
to customize every component of the toolchain: the C library (glibc, uclibc or
musl), the version of GCC, binutils, kernel headers, and many other options.

\subsection{Packages}

Packages in Buildroot are stored in the {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont package}
directory. Every package consists of at least three files:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Config.in: contains the Kconfig code necessary to display the package
  and its options in the configuration tool. It is important to specify all
  the dependencies in this file.
  \item .mk file: a Makefile containing the instructions involved since the
  source code of the package is downloaded until it is finally installed to the
  target.
  \item .hash file: a file containing the hashes of the files downloaded by the
  package, such as its tarball and the license file.
  \item Optionally, it is possible to store patches which are applied before
  configuring the package.
\end{itemize}
As packages are based on different build systems, Buildroot offers several
infrastructures to facilitate the integration of new packages. Among them, there
are infrastructures for CMake, Autotools and Python-based packages. A generic
package intrastructure is also available for packages not using any of the more
common build systems.

\subsection{Contributing to the project}

There are four stable releases of Buildroot every year: in February, May, August
and November. Each release has a tag with the following format:
\textless year\textgreater.\textless month\textgreater, being 2018.05 the latest
release at the time of writing this document. There is one long term support
release every year, \textless year\textgreater.02, maintained during one year
with security, bug and build fixes.\\\\
It is possible to contribute to the project by reviewing, testing and sending
patches. After a patch is sent, it is discussed with the people on the mailing
list, which will generally lead to doing some modifications. Finally, if the
project maintainers consider that the patch is ready to be applied, it is
commited to its corresponding branch.

\newpage
\section{LLVM} \label{LLVM}

This section presents LLVM, an open source project that provides a set of
low level toolchain components (assemblers, compilers, debuggers, etc.) which
are designed to be compatible with existing tools typically used on Unix
systems. While LLVM provides some unique capabilities and is known for some of
its tools, such as the Clang compiler (C/C++/Objective-C compiler which provides
a number of benefits with respect to the GCC compiler), the main thing that
distinguishes LLVM from other compilers is its internal architecture.

\subsection{The project}

The LLVM (used to be an acronym of Low Level Virtual Machine but not anymore)
project started in the year 2000 as a result of a masters thesis
\footnote{https://llvm.org/pubs/2002-12-LattnerMSThesis.html} written by Chris
Lattner at the University of Illinois. This project is different from most
traditional compiler projects (such as GCC) because it is not just a
collection of individual programs, but rather a collection of libraries that
can be used to build compilers, optimizers, JIT code generators and other
compiler-related programs. LLVM is an umbrella project, which means that it has
several subprojects, such as LLVM Core (main libraries), Clang, lldb, compiler-rt,
libclc, and lld among others.\\\\
From the start, LLVM was conceived as an API which provides a compiler
infrastructure written in C++, focusing on compile time and performance
of the generated code. Thanks to this object-oriented design combined with a
complete documentation, it is easy to integrate LLVM components into third-party
projects, and this is in fact the key of the success achieved by this project.\\\\
Nowadays, LLVM is being used as a base platform to enable the implementation of
statically and runtime compiled programming languages, such as C/C++, Java,
Kotlin, Rust and Swift. This is possible because LLVM's internal structure
implements many of the common structures and patterns found in most programming
languages, allowing developers to focus only on the particular aspects.\\\\
Many big companies are using LLVM technology in their products, being Apple and
Google the main supporters of the project. Below there are some examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Apple:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All operating systems built with Clang
    \item Xcode IDE uses Clang compiler and static analyzer by default
    \item Swift uses LLVM as its compiler framework
  \end{itemize}
  \item Google:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Builds Android user space and Chrome for all platforms with Clang
    \item Android Renderscript compiler is based on LLVM
    \item Kotlin programming language compiles directly to native code via LLVM
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

However, LLVM is not only being used as a traditional C/C++ toolchain but is
gaining popularity in graphics. Such is the case of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item llvmpipe (software rasterizer)
  \item CUDA (NVIDIA Compiler SDK based on LLVM)
  \item AMDGPU open source drivers
  \item Most of OpenCL implementations are based on Clang/LLVM
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internal aspects}

Modern compiler design normally follows a three-phase approach, where the main
components are: the frontend, the optimizer and the backend. Each phase is
responsible for translating the input program into a different representation,
making it closer to the target language. LLVM follows this approach and provides
the optimizer and some backends, while frontends such as Clang live in separate
projects. This sections describes each of these 3 components and highlights the
main advantages of working with this model, focusing on LLVM IR (Intermediate
Representation).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{img/three_phase.png}
  \caption{Three-phase compiler}
  \label{fig:three_phase}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Frontend}

The frontend is the component in charge of validating the input source code,
checking and diagnosing errors, and translating it in from its original language
(eg. C/C++) to an intermediate representation (LLVM IR in this case) by doing
lexical, syntactical and semantic analysis. Apart from doing the translation,
the frontend can also perform optimizations that are language-specific.

\subsubsection{LLVM IR}

The LLVM IR is a complete virtual instruction set used throughout all phases
of the LLVM compilation strategy, and has the main following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mostly architecture-independent instruction set (RISC)
  \item Strongly typed
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Single value types (eg. i8, i32, double)
    \item Pointer types (eg. *i8, *i32)
    \item Array types, structure types, function types, etc.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Unlimited number of virtual registers in Static Single Assignment (SSA)
  \item Memory partitioned into global area, stack and heap
  \item Most operations are in three-address form
\end{itemize}
Intermediate Representation is the core of LLVM. It is fearly readable, as
it was designed in a way that is easy for the frontends to generate but
expressive enough to allow effective optimizations that produce fast code for
real targets. This intermediate representation exists in three forms: a textual
human-readable assembly format (.ll), an in-memory data structure and an on-disk
binary "bitcode format" (.bc). LLVM provides tools to convert from from textual
format to bitcode (llvm-as) and viceversa (llvm-dis). Below is an example of how
LLVM IR looks like:\\

\noindent\begin{minipage}{.25\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C,caption={C example},captionpos=b,showstringspaces=false]
int sum(int a, int b)
{
	return a+b;
}

int main()
{
	sum(1,2);
	return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.68\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C,caption={Equivalent code in LLVM IR},captionpos=b,showstringspaces=false, keywords={i32,align,define}]
; ModuleID='main.c'

target triple="x86_64-buildroot-linux-gnu"

; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone uwtable
define i32 @sum(i32, i32) #0 {
  %3 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{alloca}@> i32, align 4
  %4 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{alloca}@> i32, align 4

  %5 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{load}@> i32, i32* %3, align 4
  %6 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{load}@> i32, i32* %4, align 4
  %7 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{add}@> nsw i32 %5, %6
  <@\textcolor{magenta}{ret}@> i32 %7
}

; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind optnone uwtable
define i32 @main() #0 {
  %1 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{alloca}@> i32, align 4
  <@\textcolor{magenta}{store}@> i32 0, i32* %1, align 4
  %2 = <@\textcolor{magenta}{call}@> i32 @sum(i32 1, i32 2)
  ret i32 0
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Optimizer}

The strategy proposed by LLVM is designed to achieve high performance executables
through a system of continuous optimization. Because all of the LLVM
optimizations are modular (called passes), it is possible to use all of them
or only a subset. There are Analysis Passes and Transformation Passes. The first
ones compute some information about some IR unit (modules, functions, blocks,
instructions) without mutating it and produce a result which can be queried
by other passes. On the other hand, a Transformation Pass transforms a unit of
IR in some way, leading to a more efficient code (also in IR). It must be noted
that a transformation pass  may depend on a previous analysis pass but it cannot
depend on other transformation passes.\\\\
In general, the two main objectives of the optimization phase are improving the
execution time of the program and reducing its code size. Every LLVM pass has a
specific objective, such dead code elimination, constant propagation, combination
of redundant instructions, dead argument elimination, and many others. The fact
of using SSA form guarantees that each variable is defined only once, which helps
a lot when performing this kind of optimizations.\\\\
The tool provided by LLVM to perform optimizations is called
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont opt}. It is possible to see all possible optimizations
by executing {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont opt --help}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,caption={},captionpos=b,keywords={}]
-assumption-cache-tracker    - Assumption Cache Tracker
-atomic-expand               - Expand Atomic instructions
-barrier                     - A No-Op Barrier Pass
-basicaa                     - Basic Alias Analysis (stateless AA impl)
-basiccg                     - CallGraph Construction
-bdce                        - Bit-Tracking Dead Code Elimination
-block-freq                  - Block Frequency Analysis
-bounds-checking             - Run-time bounds checking
-branch-prob                 - Branch Probability Analysis
...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Backend}
This component, also known as code generator, is responsible for translating a
program in LLVM IR into optimized target-specific assembly. The main tasks
carried out by the backend are register allocation, instruction selection and
instruction scheduling. \\\\
Instruction selection is the process of translating LLVM IR operations into
instructions available on the target architecture, taking advantage of specific
hardware features that can lead to more efficient code. Register allocation
involves mapping variables stored in the IR virtual registers onto real registers
available in the target architecture, taking into consideration the calling
convention defined in the ABI. Once these tasks and others such as memory
allocation and instruction ordering are performed, the backend is ready to emit
the corresponding assembly code, generating either a text file or an ELF object
file as output.

\subsubsection{Retargetability}

The main advantage of the three-phase model adopted by LLVM is the possibility of
reusing components, as the optimizer always works with LLVM IR. This eases the
task of supporting new languages, as new frontends which generate LLVM IR can be
developed while reusing the optimizer and backend. On the other hand, it is
possible to bring support for more target architectures by writing a backend
and reusing the frontend and the optimizer.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{img/targets.png}
  \caption{Retargetability}
  \label{fig:targets}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Clang}

Clang is an open source compiler frontend for C/C++, Objective-C and OpenCL C
for LLVM, therefore it can use LLVM's optimizer to produce efficient code. Since
the start of its development in 2005, Clang has been focused on providing
expressive diagnostics and an easy IDE integration. As LLVM, it is written in
C++ and has a library-based architecture, which allows, for example, IDEs to use
its parser to help developers with autocompletion and refactoring.\\\\
Clang was designed to offer GCC compatibility, so it accepts most GCC's command
line arguments to specify the compiler options. However, GCC offers a lot of
extensions to the standard language while Clang's purpose is being
standard-compliant. Because of this, Clang cannot be a replacement for GCC when
compiling projects that depend on GCC extensions, as is the case with Linux kernel.
In this case, Linux does not build because Clang does not accept the following
kinds of constructs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Variable length arrays inside structures
  \item Nested Functions
  \item Explicit register variables
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, Linux kernel still depends on GNU assembler and linker.\\\\
An interesting feature of Clang is that, as opposed to GCC, it can compile
for multiple targets from the same binary, that is, it is a cross-compiler itself.
Clang binary works as a driver, which means that it calls multiple binaries to
control every phase of the compilation process, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:clang_driver}:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{img/clang_driver.png}
  \caption{Clang driver}
  \label{fig:clang_driver}
\end{figure}
To control the target for which the code will be generated, it is necessary to
specify the target triple in the command line by using the $--target=<triple>$
option. For example, {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont --target=armv7-linux-gnueabihf}
corresponds to the following system:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Architecture: arm
  \item Sub-architecture: v7
  \item Vendor:unknown
  \item OS: linux
  \item Environment: GNU
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Linux graphics stack} \label{Linux graphics stack}

This section intends to give an introduction to the Linux graphics stack in order
to explain the role of LLVM inside this complex system comprised of many open
source componentes that interact with each other. Fig. \ref{fig:stack} shows all
the components involved when 2D and 3D applications require rendering services
from an AMD GPU:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{img/stack.png}
  \caption{Typical Linux open source graphics stack for AMD GPUs}
  \label{fig:stack}
\end{figure}

\subsection{X Server}

X Server is a software system that provides 2D rendering services to allow
applications creating graphical user interfaces. It is based on a client-server
architecture and exposes its services such as managing windows, displays and
input devices through two shared libraries called Xlib and XCB. Given that X uses
network client-server technology, it is not efficient when handling 3D applications
due to its latency. Because of this, there exists a software system called Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) which provides a faster path between applications
and graphics hardware.

\subsection{The DRI/DRM infrastructure}

The Direct Rendering Infrastructure is a subsystem that allows applications using
X Server to communicate with the graphics hardware directly. The most important
component of DRI is the Direct Rendering Manager, which is a kernel module that
provides multiple services:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Initialization of GPU such as uploading firmwares or setting up DMA areas.
  \item Kernel Mode Setting(KMS): setting display resolution, colour depth and
  refresh rate.
  \item Multiplexing access to rendering hardware among multiple user-space
  applications.
  \item Video memory management and security.
\end{itemize}
DRM exposes all its services to user-space applications through libdrm. As most
of these services are device-specific, there are different DRM drivers for each
GPU, such as libDRM-intel, libDRM-radeon, libDRM-amdgpu, libDRM-nouveau, etc.
This library is intended to be used by X Server Display Drivers (such as
xserver-xorg-video-radeon, xserver-xorg-video-nvidia, etc.) and Mesa 3D, which
provides an open source implementation of the OpenGL specification.

\subsection{Mesa 3D}

OpenGL is a specification that describes an API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics
by exploiting the capabilities of the underlying hardware. Mesa 3D is a collection
of open source user-space graphics drivers that implement a translation layer
between OpenGL and the kernel-space graphics drivers and exposes the OpenGL API
as libGL.so. Mesa takes advantage of the  DRI/DRM infrastructure to access the
hardware directly and output its graphics to a window allocated by the X server,
which is done by GLX, an extension that binds OpenGL to the X Window System.
\\\\ Mesa provides multiple drivers for AMD, Nvidia and Intel GPUs and also
provides some software implementations of 3D rendering, useful for
platforms that do not have a dedicated GPU. Mesa drivers are divided in two groups:
Messa Classics and Gallium 3D. The second group is a set of utilities and
common code that is shared by multiple drivers, such as nouveau (Nvidia),
RadeonSI (AMD GCN) and softpipe (CPU).\\\\
As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:mesa_drivers}, LLVM is used by llvmpipe and RadeonSI,
but it can optionally be used by r600g if OpenCL support is needed. The llvmpipe
is a multithreaded software rasterizer uses LLVM to do JIT compilation of GLSL shaders.
Shaders, point/line/triangle rasterization and vertex processing are implemented
in LLVM IR, which is then translated to machine code. Another much more optimized
software rasterizer is OpenSWR, which is developed by Intel and targets x86\_64
processors with AVX or AVX2 capabilities. Both llvmpipe and OpenSWR present a
much faster alternative to the classic Mesa's single-threaded softpipe.\\\\

\section{LLVM/Clang integration to Buildroot} \label{LLVM/Clang integration to Buildroot}

The main purpose of this internship is to integrate LLVM/Clang packages to
Buildroot. These packages will activate new functionalities such as enabling
Mesa 3D's llvmpipe software rasterizer (useful for systems which do not have a
dedicated GPU) and providing OpenCL support for packages which are already
available in Buildroot. Once LLVM is present on the system, new packages
that rely on this infrastructure can be added. When this part of the project is
achieved, a next step would be creating a cross-compilation toolchain based on
Clang to compile Buildroot components supported by this front-end.\footnote{Mainline
Linux kernel and glibc do not yet compile with Clang}

\section*{State of the project - 2 March 2018}
After some research concerning the state of the art of the LLVM project, the objectives
of the internship were presented and discussed at the Buildroot Developers Meeting
in Brussels\footnote{https://elinux.org/Buildroot:DeveloperDaysFOSDEM2018}, obtaining
the following conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item LLVM itself is very useful for other packages (Mesa 3D's llvmpipe or OpenJDK's
        Jit compiler).
  \item It is questionable whether there is a need for Clang in Buildroot, as GCC
        is still needed and it has mostly caught up with Clang regarding performance,
        diagnostics and static analysis. It would be possible to build a complete
        userspace but some packages may break.
  \item LLVM does not have a stable API between major releases, so only these releases
        can be used.
  \item It could be useful to have a host-clang package that is user selectable.
  \item The long-term goal is to have a complete clang-based toolchain.
\end{itemize}
The first patch series aims only to activate LLVM support for Mesa 3D, and is divided
into the following 3 patches:
\begin{itemize}
  \item package/llvm: new host package
  \item package/llvm: enable target variant
  \item package/mesa3d: enable llvm support
\end{itemize}
It must be considered that with respect to the RFC series,
\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2017-July/196163.html}
AMDGPU target support was removed and it will be added once it can be tested.
Currently, the supported targets are x86, ARM and AArch64, and llvm.mk ensures
that only the necessary target backends are built.

\subsection*{Considerations}

\subsubsection*{LLVM Makefile}
In order to cross-compile LLVM for the target, llvm-config and llvm-tblgen tools
must first be compiled for the host. In the first patch series, a minimal version of
host-llvm containing only these two tools is provided. To do this, most of the
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HOST\_LLVM\_CONF\_OPTS} are set to OFF. However,
this does not avoid building LLVM libraries, which takes around one hour on a
recent machine. To avoid this and build only the necessary tools:\\
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont HOST\_LLVM\_MAKE\_OPTS = llvm-tblgen llvm-config}\\\\
Things that need to be considered when cross-compiling LLVM:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Path to host's llvm-tblgen: {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  -DLLVM\_TABLEGEN}
  \item Specify that it is a cross-compilation: {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  -DCMAKE\_CROSSCOMPILING}
  \item Default target triple: {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  -DLLVM\_DEFAULT\_TARGET\_TRIPLE}
  \item Host triple (native code generation for the target): {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  -DLLVM\_HOST\_TRIPLE}
  \item Target architecture: {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  -DLLVM\_TARGET\_ARCH}
  \item Targets to build: {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  -DLLVM\_TARGETS\_TO\_BUILD}
\end{itemize}
The result of the compilation will be one shared library containing all LLVM
libraries called libLLVM.so, as {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
-DLLVM\_BUILD\_LLVM\_DYLIB} is set to ON.\\\\
One important step in the process is the fact of replacing llvm-config in STAGING\_DIR
by its host variant. This is because llvm-config compiled for the target cannot
run on the host, and this tool is needed to build applications that use LLVM libraries,
as it prints the compiler flags, linker flags and object libraries needed to link
against LLVM.

\subsubsection*{Mesa 3D}
Currently, Mesa 3D is statically linking against LLVM libraries. When setting the
option {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont MESA3D\_CONF\_OPTS += --enable-llvm-shared-libs},
the build fails because it cannot find LLVM libraries. Apparently, the problem is
that llvm-config placed in STAGING\_DIR is not working properly, as it provides
the following output to this commands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont./llvm-config --shared-mode\\
        static}
  \item {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont./llvm-config --link-shared\\
        llvm-config: error: libLLVM-5.0.so is missing}

  \item {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont./llvm-config --libnames\\
        libLLVMLTO.a libLLVMPasses.a libLLVMObjCARCOpts.a...}
\end{itemize}
Even if llvm-config returns the correct lib directory, it assumes it has to use
LLVM static libraries, and as the configure script from Mesa 3D calls
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont llvm-config --link-shared --libs} (in case
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont --enable-shared-libs} is activated) the build
fails. Mesa's configure script clearly states that llvm-config may not give
the correct output when LLVM is built as a single shared library.

\subsection*{Achievements}
At this date, Mesa 3D's llvmpipe was successfully tested on the following systems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item x86\_64
  \item ARM
  \item AArch64
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{x86\_64}
The tests for x86\_64 were done using an AMD A4-3300M microprocessor. The built
system uses a Linux kernel 4.9, X window system and works correctly with OpenGL.
During this test it was possible to appreciate the better performance provided by
llvmpipe with respect to softpipe.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{img/llvmpipe-glspecs.png}
  \caption{OpenGL specs}
  \label{fig:llvmpipe-glspecs}
\end{figure}
Some benchmarks were run in order to compare llvmpipe against Mesa 3D's classic
softpipe software rasterizer and also against the AMD Radeon HD6480.
Table \ref{tab:glmark2_x86} shows how much the LLVM code optimizer improves
rendering performance:
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Results of GLMark2 and GLMark2-es2 benchmarks on x86\_64}

    llvmpipe & 47 & 52 \\
    softpipe & 3 & 3 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\newpage
\subsubsection*{ARM}
In order to test LLVM for ARM architecture, Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3
development boards were used. For the case of the Raspberry Pi 3, the 32-bit
defconfig was selected.
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 Hardware Specifications}
    \label{tab:rpi_specs}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c c c }

    \hline
    RPi 2 & BCM2709 & BCM2836 @ 900 MHz & ARMv7 Cortex-A7 (Quad Core) & VC4 \\
    RPi 3 & BCM2710 & BCM2837 @ 1.2 GHz & ARMv8 Cortex-A53 (Quad Core) & VC4 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
Raspberry Pi only supports OpenGL ES, so only GLMark2-es2 could be tested. When
trying to execute {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont glmark2} the following errors are
obtained:\\\\
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Error: GLX version >= 1.3 is required}\\\\
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Error: Error: Couldn't get GL visual config}\\\\
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Error: main: Could not initalize canvas}\\\\

    RPi3 (32-bit) llvmpipe & 11\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:glmark2_ARM} shows an improvement in rendering when LLVM is used,
and also the higher computing power of the Cortex-A53 microprocessor with
respect to the Cortex-A7.

\subsubsection*{AArch64}
Buildroot offers a defconfig to install a 64-bit system on the Raspberry Pi 3
(raspberrypi3\_64\_defconfig). There is a little improvement in rendering with
respect to the 32-bit version:
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Results of GLMark2-es2 for AArch64}
    \label{tab:glmark2_AArch64}

    RPi3 (64-bit) softpipe & 0\\
    RPi3 (64-bit) llvmpipe & 13\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
\subsection*{Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By default, the defconfigs for Raspberry Pi present in Buildroot have
    /dev management set to {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Dynamic using devtmps only}.
    This must be changed to {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Dynamic using devtmps +
    eudev} in order to allow Linux kernel to load modules dyamically, such as the
    VC4 device driver.

    \item To load VC4 device driver, assuming that the {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
    /boot} partition has the {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont overlays/} directory with
    its dtbo files inside, the next options must be configured:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Add cma=256M to cmdline.txt
      \item Set gpu\_mem/gpu\_mem\_1024 to 256 in config.txt
      \item Add dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d to config.txt
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
These steps allow to load the VC4 driver correctly, however it is not yet
working well with X. When trying to execute any {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
glx} command, such as {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont glxinfo} or
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont glxgears}, it returns the following error:\\\\
{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig}\\\\
Possible causes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mesa is not installing libglx.so in {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/}.
  \item Mesa 3D package in Buildroot states that a vanilla kernel 4.5+ must
  be used with Gallium VC4 (defconfig uses kernel from raspberrypi's Github).
  However, even in this case or using Eric Anholt's kernel\footnote{https://github.com/anholt/mesa/wiki/VC4-complete-Raspbian-upgrade}
  the error persists.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Next steps}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Enable dynamic linking for Mesa 3D. This is important because when building
        packages that link against LLVM libraries the same problem may arise.
  \item For Raspberry Pi:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Activate glx.
      \item Activate OpenGL for VC4.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Prepare next patch series:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Provide an option to do a full installation of host-llvm.
    \item Activate OpenCL.
    \item Add Clang package (needs full host-llvm installed).
    \item Add support for more targets.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Update - 9 March 2018}

\subsection*{Full host-llvm}
After having investigated why Mesa 3D was not able to link dynamically against
libLLVM.so, it was found that the bug in llvm-config presented in section \textbf{Mesa 3D}
occurs when the option LLVM\_LINK\_LLVM\_DYLIB is not enabled. The purpose of this
option is to generate a single shared library (libLLVM.so) and dynamically link
LLVM tools with it.\\\\
A priori, as llvm-tblgen and llvm-config are the only necessary tools for the host
(llvm-tblgen to cross-compile LLVM for the target and llvm-config to provide linking
options to packages that link against LLVM libraries), it was decided to do a
minimal host-llvm installation. However, to get the correct output from llvm-config,
it must be linked with libLLVM.so (host-variant), so this library must also be built.
Because of this, the first approach changed and the first patch of the series
(package/llvm: new host package) will provide a full installation of LLVM (tools
and libraries). This approach will avoid conflicts for packages linking with
LLVM libraries and will also facilitate the integration of Clang front-end, which
will be provided in a future patch series.

\subsection*{PATCH v3}
The PATCH v3 series\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-March/215490.html}
sent to the Buildroot mailing list on the $9^{th}$ March contains the following
6 commits:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {[PATCH v3 1/6]} package/llvm: new host package
  \item {[PATCH v3 2/6]} package/llvm: enable target variant
  \item {[PATCH v3 3/6]} package/llvm: enable AMDGPU
  \item {[PATCH v3 4/6]} package/mesa3d: enable llvm support
  \item {[PATCH v3 5/6]} package/llvm: enable ARM
  \item {[PATCH v3 6/6]} package/llvm: enable AArch64
\end{itemize}
This series provides LLVM backends for x86, ARM, AArch64 and AMDGPU (R600 to
GCN). With respect to the previous version, host-llvm is entirely built because
of the reasons explained above.

\newpage
\section*{Update - 29 March 2018}

\subsection*{New series to enable OpenCL}
Once LLVM was tested working on the three more common architectures (x86, ARM and
Aarch64), the next goal was activating OpenCL support. This task involved
multiple steps, as there are many dependencies which need to be satisfied.\\\\
OpenCL is an API enabling general purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) and other
devices (CPUs, DSPs, FPGAs, ASICs, etc.), being well suited for certain kinds of
parallel computations, such as hash cracking (SHA, MD5, etc.), image processing and
simulations.\\\\
OpenCL presents itself as a library with a simple interface:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Standarized API headers for C and C++
  \item The OpenCL library (libOpenCL.so), which is a collection of types and
  functions which all conforming implementations must provide.
\end{itemize}
The standard is made to provide many OpenCL platforms on one system, where each
platform can see various devices. Each device has certain compute characteristics
(number of compute units, optimal vector size, memory limits, etc). The OpenCL
standard allows to load OpenCL kernels which are pieces of C99-like code that is
JIT-compiled by the OpenCL implementations (most of them rely on LLVM to work),
and execute these kernels on the target hardware. Functions are provided to
compile the kernels, load them, transfer data back and forth from the target
devices, etc.\\\\
There are multiple open source OpenCL implementations for Linux:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Clover (Computing Language over Gallium)}\\\\
  It is a hardware independent OpenCL API implementation that works with Gallium
  Drivers (hardware dependent userspace GPU drivers) which was merged into Mesa 3D
  in 2012. It currently supports OpenCL 1.1 and it is close to 1.2. It has the
  following dependencies:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{libclang}: provides an OpenCL C compiler frontend and generates LLVM IR.
      \item \textbf{libLLVM}: LLVM IR optimization passes and hardware dependent code
      generation.
      \item \textbf{libclc}: implementation of the OpenCL C standard library in LLVM IR
      bitcode providing device builtin functions. It is linked at runtime.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pocl}\\\\
  This implementation is OpenCL 1.2 standard compliant and supports some 2.0
  features. The major goal of this project is to improve performance portability
  of OpenCL programs, reducing the need for target-dependent manual optimizations.
  Pocl currently supports many CPUs (x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC), ASPIs(TCE/TTA),
  NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA (experimental), HSA-supported GPUs and multiple private
  off-tree targets. It also works with libclang and libLLVM but it has its own
  Pocl Builtin Lib (instead of using libclc).
  \item \textbf{Beignet}\\\\
  It targets Intel GPUs (HD and Iris) starting with Ivy Bridge, and offers
  OpenCL 2.0 support for Skylake, Kaby Lake and Apollo Lake.
  \item \textbf{ROCm}\\\\
  This implementation by AMD targets ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) compatible
  hardware\footnote{https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm} (HPC/Hyperscale),
  providing OpenCL 1.2 API with OpenCL C 2.0. It has become open source in May
  2017.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Open source OpenCL implementations}
    \label{tab:opencl_implementations}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    Project & Version & Hardware \\
    \hline
    Clover & 1.1 & AMD\\
    Pocl & 1.2 & CPU, NVIDIA\footnote{Needs propietary drivers}, AMD\footnote{HSA
    compatible hardware}, TCE/TTA\\
    Beignet & 2.0 & Intel\\
    ROCm OpenCL & 1.2 & AMD\footnote{ROCm compatible hardware}\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
Because of this fragmentation concerning OpenCL implementations (without taking
into account the propietary ones) there exists a program that allows multiple
implementations to co-exist on the same sytem: OpenCL ICD (Installable Client
Driver). It needs the following components to work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{libOpenCL.so (ICD loader)}: this library dispatches the OpenCL
  calls to OpenCL implementations.
  \item \textbf{/etc/OpenCL/vendors/*.icd}: these files tell the ICD loader which
  OpenCL implementations (ICDs) are installed on the sytem. Each file has a single
  line containing the name of the shared library with the implementation.
  \item \textbf{One or more OpenCL implementations (the ICDs)}: the shared libraries
  pointed by the .icd files.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection*{Preparation of the new series}
Considering that the available system for tests has an AMD Radeon Dual Graphics
GPU (integrated HD6480G + dedicated HD7450M) and that Mesa 3D is already present
in Buildroot, it was decided to work with the OpenCL implementation provided by
Clover. The diagram in Fig.\ref{fig:clover} shows which are the necessary
components to set up the desired OpenCL environment and how they interact with
each other.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{img/clover.png}
  \caption{Clover OpenCL implementation}
  \label{fig:clover}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Clang for host}
The first step was providing Clang package for the host, as it is necessary to
build libclc because this library is written in OpenCL C and some functions
are implemented directly in LLVM IR. Clang will transform .cl and .ll source
files into LLVM IR bitcode (.bc) by calling llvm-as (the LLVM assembler).\\\\
Regarding the Makefile for building host-clang, the path to host's llvm-config
must be specified. This is necessary because Clang is thought to be built as a
tool inside LLVM's tree (LLVM\_SOURCE\_TREE/tools/clang) but Buildroot manages
packages individually, so Clang's code source cannot be downloaded inside LLVM's
tree.\\\\
Having Clang installed on the host is not only useful for building libclc, it
also provides an alternative to GCC, which enables the possibility of creating
a new toolchain based on it.

\newpage
\subsubsection*{Clang for target}
When trying to cross-compile Clang some problems were encountered, so it was
decided to work with ARM architecture in order to make sure that a build on x86
was successful not just because of binary compatibility. The main issues were the
following ones:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{llvm-tblgen}\\\\
  When trying to cross-compile Clang, the build broke with the following error:\\\\
  {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont llvm-tblgen: cannot execute binary file: Exec
  format error}\\\\
  This means that llvm-tblgen from STAGING\_DIR (cross-compiled) was trying to be
  executed on the host machine. Because of this, it was necessary to copy
  llvm-tblgen from host to STAGING\_DIR/usr/bin. This is the same kind of problem
  that arised with llvm-config, which was explained before.

  \item \textbf{llvm-config}\\\\
  It is necessary to specify the path to llvm-config installed in STAGING\_DIR:\\\\
  {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont -DLLVM\_CONFIG:FILEPATH=\$(STAGING\_DIR)/usr/bin/llvm-config}

  \item \textbf{Shared libs}\\\\
  When Clang was built for the host, it generated multiple static libraries
  (libclangAST.a, libclangFrontend.a, libclangLex.a, etc.) and finally a shared
  object (libclang.so) containing all of them. However, when building for the
  target, it produced multiple shared libraries and finally libclang.so. This
  resulted in the following error when trying to use software that links against
  libOpenCL, which statically links with libclang (e.g, clinfo):\\\\
  {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
  \$ CommandLine Error: Option 'track-memory' registered more than once!\\
  \$ LLVM ERROR: inconsistency in registered CommandLine options
  }\\\\
  The solution to this was specifying explicitely to the CMake infrastructure that
  shared libraries should not be built:\\\\
  {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont CLANG\_CONF\_OPTS += -DBUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS=OFF}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{libclc}
This library provides an implementation of the library requirements of the
OpenCL C programming language, as specified by the OpenCL 1.1 specification.
It is designed to be portable and extensible, as it provides generic
implementations of most library requirements, allowing targets to override them
at the granularity of individual functions, using LLVM intrinsics for example.
It currently supports AMDGCN, R600 and NVPTX targets.\\\\
There is a particular problem with libclc: when OpenCL programs call clBuildProgram
function\footnote{https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/2.0/docs/man/xhtml/clBuildProgram.html}
in order to compile and link a program (generally an OpenCL kernel) from source
during execution, they require clc headers to be located in /usr/include/clc.
This is not possible because Buildroot removes /usr/include from the target as
the embedded platform is not intended to store development files,
mainly because there is no compiler installed on it. But since OpenCL works with
libLLVM to do code generation, a place to store clc headers must be found.\\\\
The file that adds the path to libclc headers is invocation.cpp, located at
src/gallium/state\_trackers/clover/llvm, inside Mesa's source tree:\\

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,caption={Extract from invocation.cpp},captionpos=b]
// Add libclc generic search path
c.getHeaderSearchOpts().AddPath(LIBCLC_INCLUDEDIR,
                                clang::frontend::Angled,
                                false, false);
// Add libclc include
c.getPreprocessorOpts().Includes.push_back("clc/clc.h");
\end{lstlisting}

Variable LIBCLC\_INCLUDEDIR is defined in Mesa's configure.ac:\\

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,caption={Extract from configure.ac},captionpos=b]
LIBCLC_INCLUDEDIR=`$PKG_CONFIG --variable=includedir libclc`
LIBCLC_LIBEXECDIR=`$PKG_CONFIG --variable=libexecdir libclc`
\end{lstlisting}

Currently, header files are being copied to /usr/include/clc once the root
filesystem is generated, but this solution only works for testing because systems
generated with Buildroot must work directly after being built. The next step
is to test if LIBCLC\_INCLUDEDIR can be overwritten by specifying another path
instead of using pkg-config.

\subsubsection*{clinfo}
Clinfo is a simple command-line application that enumerates all possible (known)
properties of the OpenCL platform and devices available on the system. It tries
to output all possible information, including those provided by platform-specific
extensions.\\\\
This application is built with a simple Makefile, so when creating the package
for Buildroot it was sufficient to call the generic-package infrastructure. The
main purposes of it are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Verifying that the OpenCL environment is set up correctly. If clinfo
  cannot find any platform or devices (or fails to load the OpenCL dispatcher
  library), chances are high no other OpenCL application will run.
  \item Verifying that the OpenCL development environment is set up correctly:
  if clinfo fails to build, chances are high that no other OpenCL application will
  build.
  \item Reporting the actual properties of the available devices.
\end{itemize}
Once installed on the target, clinfo successfully found Clover and the devices
available to work with, providing the following output:\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,caption={Output of clinfo},captionpos=b,keywords={}]

\subsubsection*{Piglit}
Piglit is a collection of automated tests for OpenGL and OpenCL implementations.
The goal of this project is to help improving the quality of open source OpenGL and
OpenCL drivers by providing developers with a simple means to perform regression
tests.\\\\
Once Clover was installed on the target system, it was decided to run Piglit in
order to verify Mesa's OpenCL implementation conformance, taking the packaging
for Buildroot from Romain Naour's series
\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-February/213601.html}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {[PATCH v2 1/3]} package/python-numpy: add host variant for piglit
  \item {[PATCH v2 2/3]} package/waffle: new package
  \item {[PATCH v2 3/3]} package/piglit: new package
\end{itemize}
To run the OpenCL test suite, the following command must be executed:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
  piglit run tests/cl results/cl
\end{lstlisting}
The results are written in JSON format, and can be converted to HTML by running:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
  piglit summary html --overwrite summary/cl results/cl
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{img/html_output.png}
  \caption{OpenCL Test Suite results in HTML}
  \label{fig:html_output}
\end{figure}
The results of the OpenCL test suite were the following ones:
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Piglit OpenCL Test Suite on AMD SUMO + AMD CAICOS}
    \label{tab:piglit_opencl}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
    Total & Skip & Pass & Fail & Crash \\
    \hline
    704 & \color{blue}{94} & \color{green}{541} & \color{red}{60} & 9
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}\\
Most of the tests that failed can be classified in the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Program build with optimization options for OpenCL C 1.0/1.1+
  \item Global atomic operations (add, and, or, max, etc.) using a return variable
  \item Floating point multiply-accumulate operations
  \item Some builtin shuffle operations
  \item Global memory
  \item Image read/write 2D
  \item Tail calls
  \item Vector load
\end{itemize}
Some failures are due to missing hardware support for particular operations, so
it would be useful to run Piglit with a more recent GPU using RadeonSI Gallium
driver in order to compare the results. It would also be interesting to test
with both GPUs which packages can benefit from OpenCL support using Clover.
\subsection*{PATCH v4}
The PATCH v4 series\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-March/216772.html}
sent to the Buildroot mailing list on the $29^{th}$ March contains the following
11 commits:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {[PATCH v4 1/11]} package/llvm: new host package
  \item {[PATCH v4 2/11]} package/llvm: enable target variant
  \item {[PATCH v4 3/11]} package/llvm: enable AMDGPU
  \item {[PATCH v4 4/11]} package/mesa3d: enable llvm support
  \item {[PATCH v4 5/11]} package/llvm: enable ARM
  \item {[PATCH v4 6/11]} package/llvm: enable AArch64
  \item {[PATCH v4 7/11]} package/clang: new host package
  \item {[PATCH v4 8/11]} package/clang: enable target variant
  \item {[PATCH v4 9/11]} package/libclc: new package
  \item {[PATCH v4 10/11]} package/mesa3d: enable OpenCL support
  \item {[PATCH v4 11/11]} package/clinfo: new package
\end{itemize}
This series presents some improvements of the patches sent in the previous version
and adds the necessary packages to enable OpenCL support for AMD GPUs: Clang and
libclc. Clinfo package is also included in this series as it is a means to check
whether Clover is correctly set up.

\section*{Update - 13 April 2018}
A Buildroot hackathon gathering the core developers of the project took place
during the March 31-April 2 weekend in Paris. After an extensive review of the
v4 series by Romain Naour and Thomas Petazzoni, the following feedback was
received:
\begin{itemize}
  \item There is no need to have a visible Config.in.host option for host-llvm,
  as it is merely needed as a build dependency of the target llvm.
  \item Activate CCACHE, considering that Buildroot has CCACHE support and it
  is useful considering the size of LLVM.
  \item LLVM needs a toolchain with thread and C++ support.
  \item Some options are already passed by the CMake package infrastructure of
  Buildroot, so they are not necessary in llvm.mk, such as CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX
  and -G "Unix Makefiles".
  \item Manage LLVM\_TARGETS\_TO\_BUILD in a more extensible way to add more backends.
  \item Support for ARM and AArch64 architectures should go directly in the
  first patch of the series.
  \item Clang binaries must be removed from the target, as there are no development
  files (headers) and other build tools.
\end{itemize}
Taking into account all these considerations, the next version of the series
was prepared.

\subsection*{PATCH v5}
The PATCH v5 series\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-April/218023.html}
sent to the Buildroot mailing list on the $4^{th}$ April contains the  following
7 commits:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {[PATCH v5 1/7]} package/llvm: new package
  \item {[PATCH v5 2/7]} package/llvm: enable AMDGPU
  \item {[PATCH v5 3/7]} package/mesa3d: enable llvm support
  \item {[PATCH v5 4/7]} package/clang: new package
  \item {[PATCH v5 5/7]} package/libclc: new package
  \item {[PATCH v5 6/7]} package/mesa3d: enable OpenCL support
  \item {[PATCH v5 7/7]} package/clinfo: new package
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Achievements}
LLVM package\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-April/218058.html}
and LLVM support for Mesa 3D\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-April/218060.html}
were commited to Buildroot's master branch on the $4^{th}$ April.
\subsection*{Bug fixing}
Thanks to Buildroot autobuilders\footnote{http://autobuild.buildroot.org/} it was
possible to detect some bugs that were not found during development. These
autobuilders are machines that select a target architecture, a toolchain, some
packages randomly and try to build the configuration. There is a daily report
containing the results of the autobuilders that shows which packages failed to
build for a particular configuration. It is also possible to analyze the build
log and the .config file so that bugs can be quickly corrected.

\subsubsection*{GCC Bug 64735}

\end{lstlisting}
Fix (Thomas Petazzoni):\\\\
This autotest was targeting an ARM926EJ-S processor (ARMv5 architecture). LLVM
uses std::shared\_future, which until gcc 7.x is not available on architectures
that do not provide lock-free atomics: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=64735.
Buildroot already has a BR2\_TOOLCHAIN\_HAS\_GCC\_BUG\_64735 option to handle such a
case, so this new dependency must be added to LLVM. It will make sure LLVM does
not get built on ARMv5 platforms using a GCC older than 7.x.\\\\

\subsubsection*{Shared libraries}

\end{lstlisting}
Fix:\\\\
Buildroot provides an option to build and use only static libraries on the target
system. LLVM will not work in this case as it generates shared libraries. Because
of this, the package should not be available if BR2\_STATIC\_LIBS is set.\\\\

\end{lstlisting}

LLVM uses std::wstring, so a toolchain with wchar support is necessary.\\\\

\subsubsection*{llvm-config's RPATH}

error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.0: cannot open shared object
file: No such file or directory
\end{lstlisting}
Fix:\\\\
In this case, Mesa 3D failed to build because it could not correctly execute
llvm-config. The problem is the following: llvm-config (host version installed in
STAGING\_DIR) is not being able to link correctly with the libc of the host system.
This happens in the following scenario: target architecture = host architecture
(normally x86\_64) and target's libc different from host's libc (normally glibc).\\\\
As the RPATH of llvm-config specifies \$ORIGIN/../lib (seen using readelf -d
llvm-config) and the binary is located in STAGING\_DIR/usr/bin, it tries to link
with the libc of the target, resuting in the error displayed above.\\\\
It was found that function {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont llvm\_setup\_rpath} in
AddLLVM.cmake sets this RPATH, but it just returns in case CMAKE\_INSTALL\_RPATH
is defined. So the final solution was passing HOST\_LLVM\_CONF\_OPTS += -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_RPATH="\$(HOST\_DIR)/lib"
in llvm.mk, so that LLVM binaries compiled for the host always link with host's
libraries.\\\\
Commit: http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-April/218938.html

\subsection*{Preparation of the new series}
After having fixed the bugs found by the autobuilders, the OpenCL series was
retaken, adding the following improvements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In order to cross-compile Clang, now llvm-tblgen from the host is used.
  llvm-tblgen is no longer copied to STAGING\_DIR/usr/bin.
  \item libclc headers are now installed to /usr/local/include by using the
  --includedir option in libclc.mk. This directory is not removed by Buildroot
  when generating the target root filesystem.
  \item Some missing dependencies were propagated.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Update - 23 April 2018}
\subsection*{OpenCL for Broadcom Videocore IV}
The next goal was adding OpenCL support for the Broadcom Videocore IV GPU in
Buildroot. This is an interesting feature considering that this GPU is embedded
in all Raspberry Pi models.
\subsubsection*{Videocore IV architecture}
The VC4 has multiple instances of a special purpose floating-point shader processor,
called a Quad Processor (QPU). The QPU is a 16-way SIMD processor, where each
processor has two vector floating point ALUs which carry out multiply and
non-multiply operations in parallel with single instruction cycle latency.
Internally the QPU is a 4-way SIMD processor multiplexed 4x over four cycles
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.85]{img/vc4_qpu_vector.png}
  \caption{QPU data model}
  \label{fig:html_output}
\end{figure}
QPU is SIMD architecture (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), this means that one
instruction operates on a vector of elements. When looking from the programmer's
point of view, it processes a vector of 16 elements each 32-bits long. If physical
structure is taken into account, a QPU processes only a 4-element vector (quad).
By repeating the instruction 4 times for consecutive quads in a 16-element vector,
it provides a virtual SIMD-16.\\\\
QPUs are organized into groups of up to four, termed slices, which share certain
common resources: each slice shares an instruction cache, a Special Function Unit
(for recip/recipsqrt/log/exp functions), one or two Texture and Memory lookup units
and Interpolation units. As the Videocore IV has 3 slices of 4 QPUs each one,
it provides 12 QPUs and 3 SFUs, which makes this GPU an interesting option for
solving problems that present data level parallelism. Broadcom claims a computational
power of 24 GFLOPs, which comes out from the following equation:\\\\
250 MHz (Clock Rate) * 4-Way SIMD * 2 Asymmetric ALUs * 12 QPUs = 24 GFLOPs
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{img/vc4_qpu.png}
  \caption{Simplified architecture of the Videocore IV}
  \label{fig:html_output}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{VC4CL}
There is an open source project called VC4CL\footnote{https://github.com/doe300/VC4CL/wiki}
which provides an implementation that supports the EMBEDDED PROFILE (trimmed
version of the default FULL PROFILE) of the OpenCL 1.2 standard for the VideoCore
IV GPU. This implementation consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The VC4CL OpenCL runtime library, running on the CPU to compile,
    run and interact with OpenCL kernels.
    \item The VC4C compiler, converting OpenCL kernels into machine code. This
    compiler also provides an implementation of the OpenCL built-in functions.
    \item The VC4CLStdLib, the platform-specific implementation of the OpenCL C
    standard library, it is linked with the kernel via VC4C.
\end{itemize}
The {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont cl\_khr\_icd} extension is supported to allow
VC4CL to be found by an installable client driver loader (ICD). As explained
before, it allows VC4CL to be used in parallel with other OpenCL implementations.
\\\\
Not supported features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 64-bit data-types (long and double via {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont cl\_khr\_fp64})
  are unsupported, since the Videocore IV GPU only provides 32-bit instructions.
  \item The {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont cl\_khr\_fp16} half floating-point type is
  also not supported.
  \item Images (WIP).
  \item Any application which requires a work-group with more than 12 work-items.
  \item Using VC4CL in combination with other applications using the VideoCore IV
  GPU (e.g. the VC4 Mesa driver) is untested and can cause issues on both sides.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{VC4CL package for Buildroot}
In order to install VC4CL, VC4CLStdLib and VC4C are needed. As these projects
are thought to be installed natively on top of a Raspbian distribution, some changes
were made to cross-compile them under the Buildroot environment.\\\\
When instaling VC4CLStdLib, it was necessary to change the location
of its header files to /usr/local/include, as they are required on runtime by the
VC4C compiler and, as explained before, Buildroot removes the /usr/include
directory from the target filesystem.\\\\
One particularity of this implementation is that it calls Clang binaries in order
to compile OpenCL kernels on the target instead of linking with libclang, as most
OpenCL implementations do. Even if the package was tested and working, this fact
prevents this patch series from being sent to the Buildroot mailing list, as the
mantainers do not allow a compiler to be installed on the target.\\\\
The VC4C package has the same dependencies as Clang, but also needs VC4CLStdLib
and Raspberry Pi Userland, the latter providing EGL and KHR headers. Regarding
VC4C's Makefile, two hooks were added: one to copy Clang binaries to /usr/bin
(Clang's Makefile removes them from the target) and another one to install a
precompiled header (VC4CLStdLib.h.pch) that is built during VC4C's compilation
to /usr/local/include/vc4cl-stdlib, as it is a runtime dependency of VC4CL.\\\\
VC4C gives the user the possibility of choosing among three different frontends:
LLVM IR Parser, SPIR-V Reader or LLVM Library:
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Frontends}
    \label{tab:piglit_opencl}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
    \textbf{Frontend}  & \textbf{LLVM IR Parser} & \textbf{SPIR-V Reader} & \textbf{LLVM Library} \\
    \hline
    Input formats & LLVM IR text & SPIR-V text/bin & LLVM IR text/bin \\
    Speed &	Slow &	Fast &	Faster \\
    Supported LLVMs &	Standard/SPIRV &	SPIRV &	Standard/SPIRV \\
    Runtime Deps &	Clang &	SPIRV-LLVM Clang  &	Clang, libLLVM \\
    Development Deps &	- & SPIRV-Tools	& LLVM headers \\
    Configuration &	LLVMIR\_FRONTEND &	SPIRV\_FRONTEND &	LLVMLIB\_FRONTEND\\
    Supports linking & No & Yes & No
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}\\
The LLVM Library frontend was selected, as its dependencies are already packaged
in Buildroot and this is also the suggested option by the creator of the project.
It suffices to give the path to llvm-config installed in STAGING\_DIR in vc4c.mk
so that libLLVM.so can be found.\\\\
It is important to remark that CMakeLists.txt of VC4C was patched because it
needs to find and execute Clang during configuration (which can only be achieved
by passing the path to host's Clang) but needs the path to target's Clang for
runtime kernel compilation.\\\\
The last step was packaging VC4CL. This package needs ocl-icd as a dependency, so
this package was also created and VC4CL was built with ICD support, so that VC4CL.icd
containing the path to libVC4CL.so was installed to /etc/OpenCL/vendors.

\subsubsection*{Testing VC4CL}

\end{lstlisting}
Something that called the attention during the execution of clinfo was the fact
that it took much more time than expected. This application calls
clCreateProgramWithSource() in order to create a program object receiving the
source code of an OpenCL kernel as input. This step involves calling Clang, which
results in a bottleneck when using a Cortex-A7 processor running at 900Mhz
(Raspberry Pi 2), considering that OpenCL programs are made to improve execution time.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,caption={Clang invocation by clCreateProgramWithSource() },captionpos=b,keywords={}]
/usr/bin/clang -cc1 -triple spir-unknown-unknown  -O3 -ffp-contract=off
-cl-std=CL1.2 -cl-kernel-arg-info -cl-single-precision-constant
-Wno-undefined-inline -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-local-typedef
-Wno-gcc-compat -x cl -S -emit-llvm-bc -o /tmp/vc4c-DRbyiL
-include-pch /usr/local/include/vc4cl-stdlib/VC4CLStdLib.h.pch
\end{lstlisting}
Most OpenCL programs make use of this function, but compiling kernels on the
target is definitely not a viable solution. A better alternative is to compile
kernels on the host and use clCreateProgramWithBinary(). This function creates a
program object for a context, and loads specified binary data into the program
object. For this, OpenCL kernels must be compiled to LLVM bitcode by using host-clang:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,caption={Compiling OpenCL C to LLVM bitcode},captionpos=b,keywords={}]
clang -cc1 -emit-llvm-bc -o kernel_pi.bc kernel_pi.cl
\end{lstlisting}
On the other side, the program must read the corresponding bitcode file and then
create the program by calling clCreateProgramWithBinary:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C,caption={Example using clCreateProgramWithBinary},captionpos=b,showstringspaces=false]
FILE *fp;
char fileName[] = "./kernel_pi.bc";
size_t binary_size;
char *binary_buf;

/* Load kernel binary */
fp = fopen(fileName, "r");
if (!fp) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Could not read the kernel file: %s\n", fileName);
        exit(1);
}
binary_buf = (char *)malloc(MAX_BINARY_SIZE);
binary_size = fread(binary_buf, 1, MAX_BINARY_SIZE, fp);
fclose(fp);
...
...
clGetPlatformIDs(..
clGetDeviceIDs(...
clCreateContext(...
clCreateCommandQueue(...

/* Create kernel program from the kernel binary */
program = clCreateProgramWithBinary(context, 1, &device_id,
                                   (const size_t *)&binary_size,
                                   (const unsigned char **)&binary_buf,
                                   &binary_status, &error);

error = clBuildProgram(program,...
...
...
\end{lstlisting}
This approach drastically improves the performance and would be the suitable
solution when running OpenCL programs on embedded platforms. Furthermore, it does
not need major changes in the code, but compiled kernels must be shipped together
with the executable file.\\\\
In order to test some real OpenCL application, the EasyCL project was added to
Buildroot, allowing to get an idea about what kind of functionalities work
correctly. Many tests failed with the following error:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,caption={},captionpos=b,keywords={}]

It is interesting to see the results of the same test suite executed on
AMD Radeon Dual Graphics GPU (integrated HD6480G + dedicated HD7450M) using
Clover platform. First of all, the program finishes correctly, it is not aborted
with 'std::out\_of\_range' exception as with VC4CL and the results show that most

\section*{Update - 14 May 2018}

\subsubsection*{Achievements}
Clang package\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-April/219824.html}
was commited to Buildroot's master branch on the $28^{th}$ April. After that date,
two patches were sent in order to have a cleaner version of the package. As the
objective is installing only libclang.so, the first patch removes unnecessary files
from the target, more specifically the following ones:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Binaries in:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item /usr/bin
    \item /usr/libexec
  \end{itemize}
  \item Directories:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item /usr/lib/clang
    \item /usr/share/clang
    \item /usr/share/opt-viewer
    \item /usr/share/scan-build
    \item /usr/share/scan-view
  \end{itemize}
  \item Manual
  \begin{itemize}
    \item /usr/share/man/man1/scan-build.1
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The second patch serves to link libclang.so dynamically against libLLVM.so,
because at the start libclang was linking against LLVM static libraries
(libLLVMOption.a, libLLVMMCParser.a, libLLVMProfileData.a, etc.), producing duplicated
code. As Clang is an LLVM tool, it was necessary to set LLVM\_LINK\_LLVM\_DYLIB
to ON in Clang's Makefile.

\subsubsection*{Improved OpenCL series}
With respect to the v6 series, the following changes were introduced:
\begin{itemize}
  \item libclc headers are now installed to /usr/share instead of /usr/local/include.
  Given that clc headers are being installed to a non-standard location, it was
  necessary to specify this path in Mesa's configure.ac. Otherwise, pkg-config
  outputs the absolute path to these headers located in STAGING\_DIR, which causes
  a runtime error when calling clBuildProgram.
  \item libclc dependencies on target llvm were removed, as host-clang is the
  only build dependency.
  \item OpenCL support for RadeonSI was added.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{PATCH v7}
The PATCH v7 series\footnote{http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-May/220772.html}
sent to the Buildroot mailing list on the $4^{th}$ May contains the following
3 commits:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {[PATCH v7 1/3]} package/libclc: new package
  \item {[PATCH v7 2/3]} package/mesa3d: enable OpenCL support
  \item {[PATCH v7 3/3]} package/clinfo: new package
\end{itemize}

\section*{Update - 15 June 2018}

\subsection*{LLVM/Clang version 5.0.2}
LLVM and Clang version 5.0.2 were released on the $16^{th}$ May. Both releases are
API and ABI compatible with 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 and include mitigations for
CVE-2017-5715\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre\_(security\_vulnerability)}
(Spectre Variant 2) for X86 and MIPS. Due to the importance of these bufgixes,
both patches were applied to Buildroot's master branch:\\\\
LLVM bumped to version 5.0.2:\\\\
http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-May/221643.html\\\\
Clang bumped to version 5.0.2:\\\\

\subsection*{Bug fixing}

\subsubsection*{Fix for host-llvm when built with GCC 8}

Autobuild:\\\\
http://autobuild.buildroot.net/results/824c70e982d8ec7e518cf4db058767df42db6b04\\\\
Extract from log:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,keywords={}]
output/build/host-llvm-5.0.1/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/
Orc/OrcRemoteTargetClient.h:722:26: error: could not convert
'((llvm::orc::remote::OrcRemoteTargetClient<ChannelT>*)this)->
callB<llvm::orc::remote::OrcRemoteTargetRPCAPI::ReadMem>(Src, Size)'
from 'Expected<vector<unsigned char,allocator<unsigned char>>>'
to 'Expected<vector<char,allocator<char>>>'
return callB<ReadMem>(Src, Size);
\end{lstlisting}
Fix:\\\\
GCC 8.0.1 detects the type mismatch between char and unsigned char and causes the
compilation to fail. Clang and earlier versions of GCC don't detect the issue.
This bug was already known
\footnote{https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1540620} and has been
fixed upstream in LLVM 6\\\\
Commit: http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-May/221648.html
\subsubsection*{Fix host-clang binaries}
Autobuild:\\\\
This error was detected locally when trying to build libclc\\\\\\
Extract from log:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh,keywords={}]
CommandLine Error: Option 'x86-use-base-pointer' registered more than once!
LLVM ERROR: inconsistency in registered CommandLine options
\end{lstlisting}
Fix:\\\\
Clang binaries are tools, and given that DLLVM\_LINK\_LLVM\_DYLIB is set,
they are linked against libLLVM.so. The problem is that binaries are
also linking against some LLVM static libraries, which results in the error
shown above. However, it is not the same case for libclang, which is also
a tool but links only against libLLVM.so. To fix this problem,
LLVM\_DYLIB\_COMPONENTS=all must be added in Clang's Makefile so that binaries
only link against libLLVM.so and the double symbol definition is eliminated.

\subsection*{Buildroot 2018.05}

Buildroot's stable version 2018.05 was released on the $1^{st}$ June, containing
both LLVM and Clang packages:

\section{Conclusions and future work} \label{Conclusions and future work}

This document describes the whole process of integrating a new package to
Buildroot, detailing every necessary step to meet the requirements which allow
the package to be merged into the project. This involves finding all the
correct dependencies (toolchain properties or packages) and writing a Makefile
adjusting the corresponding build options. Thanks to the tests and reviews done
by the community, it was possible to advance rapidly and send improved patch
series as soon as possible.\\\\
Currently, LLVM 5.0.2, Clang 5.0.2 and LLVM support for Mesa 3D are available
in Buildroot 2018.05. The update of these packages to version 6.0.0 has been
done by another contributor and will be available in the next stable release.
The activity on the mailing list shows an interest of Buildroot users and
contributors in LLVM. Such is the case of a contributor who is creating a
package Chromium browser, which relies on Clang to be built. This contribution
also adds {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont lld}, the system linker from the LLVM
project that provides an alternative to GNU {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont ld}
and claims to be much faster than the latter one.\\\\
Regarding future work, the most immediate goal is to get OpenCL support for AMD
GPUs merged into Buildroot. The next step will be to add more packages that rely
on LLVM/Clang and OpenCL. On the other hand, the fact of creating a toolchain
based on LLVM/Clang is still being discussed on the mailing and is a topic that
requires an agreement from the core developers of the project.
